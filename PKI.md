# Public key infrastructure components :
---

### 1) Keys
- Public Key 
- Private key

### 2) Encryption : 
  - Symmetric Encryption :  - Same key for Enryption/Decryption
                            - DES : (64-bit key)
                            - 3DES : (up to 192 keys), AES (128,192 or 256 bit Keys)
  - Asymmetric Encryption : - different Key for Encryption/Decryption
                            - RSA : Generate two keys public/private 1024,2048,4096
                            - DSA : Used as complement of RSA 2048 bit key

### 3) Digital Certificates
  - A file that verify the identity of a PK holder
---
### Phases
  1) Establish trust using Digital Certificates
  2) Exchange of encrypted information
